Usage
=====
**This has only been tested in Android Studio** 

In order to use this app, you have to import it as a module and add it as a dependency to your app's main module. This method is still a little bit wobbly, due to Android Studio's youthness. 

The stuff we are going to do:

1. Download the project
2. Copy it into your project
3. Make gradle familiar with it, i.e making it a module
4. Add it as a dependency
5. Use it.

####Step 1.
Download the library from the releases tab here at github. You will get a .zip file. Extract it to a desired location. 

####Step 2.
Find the directory named "NovaViewLib" and copy it to your clipboard. Now, navigate to your Android project. In the root of the broject, i.e the directory where you find a **settings.gradle** will you need to create a new folder named "Libraries". Once you have created you directory, paste you NovaViewLib into "Libraries". 

Ya'll done? Sweet! Gimme high five!

####Step 3.
